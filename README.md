Design Thinking Process
The design thinking process is a human-centered approach to problem-solving. It
involves five key stages:
1. Empathize: Understand the needs and wants of users.
2. Define: Identify the core problem.
3. Ideate: Generate creative solutions to the problem.
4. Prototype: Build and test solutions.
5. Test: Implement solutions and collect feedback.
Phases of Development
The product demand prediction process can be divided into the
following phases:

1. Data collection: Gather relevant data, such as historical sales data, market research
data, and competitor data.
2. Data preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. Model training: Train a demand prediction model using the preprocessed data.
4. Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on a held-out test set.
5. Model deployment: Deploy the trained model to production.
Database
The following databases can be used for product demand prediction:
 Historical sales data: This database contains information about past sales, such as
product, date, quantity, and price.
 Market research data: This database contains information about customer
demographics, preferences, and behavior.
 Competitor data: This database contains information about competitor products, prices,
and marketing strategies.
Data Preprocessing

The following data preprocessing steps may be required:
 Data cleaning: Remove any errors or inconsistencies in the data.
 Data imputation: Fill in any missing values in the data.
 Feature engineering: Create new features from the existing data
Analysis Techniques

The following analysis techniques can be used for product demand
prediction:
 Time series analysis: This technique involves analyzing historical sales data to identify
trends and patterns.
 Regression analysis: This technique involves building a mathematical model to predict
demand based on historical sales data and other factors.
 Machine learning: This technique involves training a machine learning model to predict
demand based on historical sales data and other factors.
Key Findings, Insights, and Recommendations
The following are some key findings, insights, and recommendations
from product demand prediction studies:
 Demand is often seasonal: Demand for many products varies throughout the year. This
is due to factors such as holidays, weather, and economic conditions.
 Demand is often cyclical: Demand for many products fluctuates over time in a cyclical
pattern. This is due to factors such as the business cycle and technological change.

 Demand is often affected by marketing: Marketing campaigns can influence demand for
products.
 Demand is often affected by competitor activity: The actions of competitors can also
influence demand for products.

Dataset Source
The following datasets can be used for product demand prediction:
 Google Trends: This dataset contains information about search volume for different
keywords.

 Amazon Sales: This dataset contains information about sales on Amazon.com.
 Walmart Sales: This dataset contains information about sales at Walmart stores.
Submission
Conclusion
Product demand prediction is a complex task, but it is essential for businesses of all
sizes. By following the steps outlined in this document, you can develop a robust and
accurate demand prediction model.
